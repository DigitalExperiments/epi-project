#About this Project
This is a simple command-line utility to extract epigraph metadata and tags from TEI XML documents, based on the [Shakespeare Dialog Extractor](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/shakespeare-dialog-extractor). It will be used to automatically populate a database which will be used by the NYU Digital Experiments Working Group's Epigraphs Project.
